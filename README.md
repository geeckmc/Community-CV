## Current Job Profile

### [Opensi](http://www.opensi.co)
#### August 2015 - Present
##### Position - CTO
[Opensi](http://www.opensi.co)  is the most succesful tech company in Benin. Apart from being just a stack of technical expert, it is also a firm supporter of the tech community in BENIN. Hosting a lot of tech meetups in its office, anime a techHub and finance Google Developers Group Event.

I work with a team of talented developers and help in not only managing their work, but also mentoring them to take on new challenges like learning frontend for the backend developers and learning DevOps for the backend developers.

I develop in . I also have UI and UX knowledge, and know my way around frontend technologies and tools like SCSS etc. I also do DevOps when I have to for the company. I have over 12 years of experience in software engineering.

There's an [internship program](http://internship.hotels.ng) run by Me and Mark Essien (the CEO of Hotels.ng); In the program, we mentor many young software engineers (beginners to intermediate level) and develop them to be top developers. In our two editions till date, we have amassed over 1500+ applicants and the graduants are mostly placed in companies as developers, with 3 working at Hotels.ng.

## Reason for applying
Learning to develop software came at a heavy price for me personally. I had to make very difficult choices that ultimately led me to where I am currently. However, if I had some sort of support from the tech community (which didn't remotely exist 12 years ago), I may have grown faster. Now however, there is a tech community and it is growing beyond imagination. helping people develop through this community is something I always love to do and watching them grow and help others is actually a nice thing to behold.

I am passionate about development and creating new products. I have a problem and I whip up my editor and start creating a project that will attempt to solve such problem. However the best part of that is watching people adopt said solution and contributing to it because its open source.

I want to help even more young programmers grow into developers that will eventually become speakers and authors. Showing them the possibilities and the joys of helping others grow is something I love doing and something I do currently.

If I become a Google Developer Expert, I will be exposed to even more resources that I am sure would help me reach even more people with the knowledge I currently have. The experience also gained would be invaluable in providing inspiration for others out there. Every single developer that becomes a community contributor would help further the growth of tech in not only Nigeria but also Africa as a whole.

As a Google Developer Expert, I will also be a part of an existing community of awesome and talented developer who already have the passion to grow the community; this will be a source of inspiration to me personally and keep the fire burning for a very long time.


## Relationship with Google
No working relationship with Google at the moment.

I wanted companies to be able to monitor their websites and their apis and even background processes using this tool.

Created a light framework for the hotels.ng interns, this was supposed to give them a great starting base that was easier to take in than full fledged frameworks like Laravel.

Being able to help them take in smaller doses has stopped them from being overwhelmed with information.
